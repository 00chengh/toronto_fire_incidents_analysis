# Toronto Fire Services Incident Analysis
[![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.6-blue)](https://pypi.org/project/apache-airflow/)

As anyone who lives in Toronto would tell you, there is always a constant myriad of sirens echoing throughout the city. Quantifying the instances of firetrucks speeding down the downtown core is made easy with publicly available data. An easily readable map provided by the [city of Toronto](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/fire-services-basic-incident-details/) with an overlay of fire incidence per given location would allow any regular citizen to corroborate their everyday findings with real data. 
This project aims to run a breakdown analysis on fire incident data that was collected by the City of Toronto Fire Services. The datasets consist of response time intervals (dispatch, enroute, arrive and clear) and responding units, in additional to the geographical coordinates of the incidents that took place between 2011 and 2017. For privacy purposes personal information is not provided on all incidents and for medical incidents some information has been altered. If data is related to medical incidents the Forward Sortation Area (FSA) is provided in place of the Major Street and Cross Street fields.
